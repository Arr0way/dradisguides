h2. Installing Dradis on BackTrack

This guide covers how to get the latest Dradis Framework up and running in BackTrack 5.

We are going to clone the development repository of Dradis so you can be sure you are always running the latest and greatest.

Please note that eventually we will fine tune the process of pushing the latest Dradis packages to the BT repositories in a timely manner. In the mean time, you can use this guide to stay on the bleeding edge.

h3. Clone the Dradis Framework repository

Dradis is open-source and is hosted on GitHub: "github.com/dradis/dradisframework":https://github.com/dradis/dradisframework/ we are going to clone the repository to make sure we benefit of the latest features.

<shell>
root@root:~# cd /pentest/misc/
root@root:/pentest/misc# mkdir dradis-git && cd dradis-git
root@root:/pentest/misc/dradis-git# git clone https://github.com/dradis/dradisframework.git server
</shell>

h3. Get the helper scripts

Dradis comes with a bunch of helper scripts to help you start and reset the environment. We need to grab a copy of those:

<shell>
root@root:/pentest/misc/dradis-git# wget https://raw.github.com/dradis/meta/master/verify.sh
root@root:/pentest/misc/dradis-git# wget https://raw.github.com/dradis/meta/master/reset.sh
root@root:/pentest/misc/dradis-git# wget https://raw.github.com/dradis/meta/master/start.sh
root@root:/pentest/misc/dradis-git# wget https://raw.github.com/dradis/meta/master/LICENSE
root@root:/pentest/misc/dradis-git# chmod +x *.sh
</shell>

The latest BackTrack comes with all the required libraries pre-installed, but you can double-check with:
<shell>
root@root:/pentest/misc/dradis-git# ./verify.sh
</shell>

It should give you an _all green_ status. We just need a few Ruby gems (i.e. libraries) that we can get with:

<shell>
root@root:/pentest/misc/dradis-git# cd server && bundle install 
</shell>

Before we are done we need a minor patch to the code (it will eventually be added to the repo). 

Comment line #13 of [dradis-git]/server/config/environments/production.rb:

<ruby>
  
  # Specifies the header that your server uses for sending files
  # config.action_dispatch.x_sendfile_header = "X-Sendfile"

</ruby>

That's all done now, just reset the environment and start the server:
<shell>
root@root:/pentest/misc/dradis-git/server# cd ..
root@root:/pentest/misc/dradis-git# ./reset.sh # Initialize the config
root@root:/pentest/misc/dradis-git# ./start.sh
</shell>

All done now, enjoy your server at *https://127.0.0.1:3004*.

The `start.sh` script also accepts the *-h* flag to help you with additional arguments to customize the binding address and port number.


h3. Updating Dradis

Once you have a local copy of the Dradis repository. Updating is just one instruction away:

<shell>
root@root:~# cd /pentest/misc/dradis-git/server
root@root:/pentest/misc/dradis-git/server# git pull
</shell>
